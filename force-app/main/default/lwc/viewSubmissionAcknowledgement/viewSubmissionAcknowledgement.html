      Appendix B: Warranty Claim Submission Acknowledgement
    </div>
    <div class="slds-box" slot="body">
      By checking the accept box below, the Dealer acknowledges their authorized representative
      has read and understood all the information contained herein. The Dealer hereby acknowledges
      and agrees to the following:
      <br/><br/>
      Dealer has executed the appropriate service documentation an acknowledgements with the Retail
      Customer. This includes, but is not limited to, an acknowledgement of when the vehicle was
      dropped off for service, when the service work was completed, and when the Retail Customer
      picked up the completed vehicle from the Dealer.
      <br/><br/>
      Dealer has completed and will maintain documentation to show the date the Retail Customer
      dropped off the vehicle for service, when the Dealer worked on the vehicle, when the work was
      completed, (including any partial completion of work with parts on order), each contact with
      the Retail Customer, including any contact about completion of the service work, and the date
      the Retail Customer picked up the vehicle from the dealership.
      <br/><br/>
      Dealer has provided all appropriate product information and appropriate parts of products to
      the Retail Customer, as may be required by any State of Federal law, and has documentation to
      demonstrate that Dealer conveyed same to the Retail Customer.
      <br/><br/>
      Retail Customer or authorized representative of the Retail Customer has signed the appropriate
      documentation to acknowledge inspection of all work performed by the Dealer, or any sublet
      facility/personnel, and that all work has been completed and performed to Retail Customer's
      satisfaction. Failure to obtain an appropriate Retail Customer or authorized representative
      signature as noted in this Acknowledgement and SampleAbility's warranty procedure, nullifies
      any obligation that SampleAbility may have to pay related warranty claims submitted by the Dealer.
      <br/><br/>
      Dealer has a system in place, and will maintain all documentation regarding any service work
      performed on the subject vehicle for six (6) years from the date of the last service work
      performed by the Dealer. Dealer specifically acknowledges that because it submits claims to
      SampleAbility electronically, SampleAbility maintains no documentation regarding any service work
      performed by the Dealer, and Dealer is the sole party obtaining and maintaining the service
      documentation.
      <br/><br/>
      Dealer acknowledges that SampleAbility has the rights to, and may, without prior notice to the
      Dealer, audit the dealership's related documentation to ensure it is in compliance with
      SampleAbility's warranty procedures and obligations contained in this Acknowledgement. As part of
      any audit performed by SampleAbility, SampleAbility may request copies of all Dealer documentation
      regarding parts and service pertaining to the subject vehicle, and Dealer will provide the
      documentation to SampleAbility within 3 working days.
      <br/><br/>
      SampleAbility may, at anytime, contact the Retail Customer, by survey, audit or otherwise, to
      inquire about anything pertaining to the subject vehicle, including the Retail Customer's
      satisfaction level, service work performed on the vehicle, and/or anything pertaining to the
      Dealer or Retail Customer's experience with the Dealer.
      <br/><br/>
      Dealer has complied with all applicable State and Federal laws regarding service, documentation,
      parts, signatures and information required to be provided to the Retail Customer regarding any
      service issues with the subject vehicle.
      <br/><br/>
      If the Retail Customer should initiate any action against SampleAbility or the Dealer regarding the
      vehicle, SampleAbility has no obligation to defend or indemnify Dealer regarding any claims if Dealer
      has not fully complied with the information contained in this Acknowledgement and all of
      SampleAbility's warranty procedures.
      <br/><br/>
      If Dealer does not fully comply with all the requirements of this Acknowledgement, SampleAbility
      has no obligation to pay any related warranty claims submitted by the Dealer. The failure to
      comply with all the terms of this Acknowledgement and/or SampleAbility's warranty procedures,
      nullifies any obligation by SampleAbility to pay any related warranty claim submitted by the Dealer.
      <br/><br/>
      Dealer acknowledges that an authorized representative of Dealer has carefully read this Acknowledgement,
      and agrees to be bound as herein provided. Dealer also acknowledges that all questions Dealer has
      regarding this Acknowledgement have been answered to Dealer's satisfaction, and that this Acknowledgement
      has been read and/or translated to the individual accepting it in a language that the individual
      understands, such that that individual fully understands the terms of this Acknowledgement. Dealer will
      not, at any time in the future, make a claim that the individual is not an authorized representative of
      Dealer or that the individual did not understand this Acknowledgement.
