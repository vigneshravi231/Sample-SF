        Conversion Service Agreement to SampleMobility immediately after the
        customer review takes place. Additionally, the dealer agrees to maintain a
        copy of this executed document, with the appropriate signatures affixed,
        for a period of six (6) years. To ensure that completed records are
        maintained by the dealer, SampleMobility shall periodically audit the
        applicable records to determine dealer conformance. The dealer agrees top
        cooperate with SampleAbility in providing copies of these records. Failure
