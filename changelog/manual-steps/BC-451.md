# BC-451 - Content Hierarchy

### Load all Portal Document data
1. Load all `Portal_Document_Category__c` and `Portal_Document__c` records.
2. In Experience Builder, for the following pages:
   - Finance
   - Getting Seated
   - Lift Supporting Documents
   - Marketing Materials
   - Seats Supporting Documents
   - Social Media
   - Training
   - Warranty & Policy Information
   - WAV Supporting Documents
    
   Update the Category ID on each page to the corresponding Portal Document Category ID.

(Step 2 seems tedious, maybe I'll make a DeveloperName attribute for both Custom Objects)
