# BC-670 - Populate Delegated Accounts

## Why?
Delegated accounts are needed to allow for Account Switching within the portal.

Sample is currently sharing accounts with buyer (contact) using AccountContactRelation object.
We needed a way to keep AccountContactRelation and DelegatedAccount in sync

So we've created a batch that should be run only **once** to sync historical records, going forward 
the sync will be happening using `AccountContactRelationTrigger`

## Manual Steps
Execute the following from `Setup > Developer Console > Execute Anonymous`

```java
Database.executeBatch(new BatchToPopulateDelegatedAccount());
```
