# BC-410 - Order Approvals

## Ensure B2B Settings for Order Approvals are correct
1. Goto `Setup > Custom Metadata > B2B Settings > Manage > CustomerCarePlus`
2. Review and make sure the following fields are not empty:
  - `Order Approval Chatter Group`
  - `Approval Notification Author`
3. Goto `Setup > Developer Console > Execute Anonymous` and run
```java
B2B_NotificationService.getInstance().setup();
```

This will create all the necessary records if not yet created, such as:
- CollaborationGroup
- CollaborationGroupMember

If any issues the error messages that you will get back from the apex script
should help you resolve any issues
